# textbased-adventure


Status:
-
My little game is playable! The game.py file can be executed in the terminal. The game includes various items and enemies which you fight, while exploring the infamous "Lettered Dungeon". 
If you want to test/play it, just download the "game.py" file and start it in your terminal. Please make sure to have Python3 installed. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)



To-Dos:
-
- Navigation through all rooms with commands (stopped in order to finish a first, playable version without to much commands.)
- Further commands for a more individual gaming experience (e.g. like checkPosition, changeRoom, fight, runAway, hide, steal)
- Safe function with saving the current character and room status in an external file (e.g. txt).
- Load function for loading a saved character/game



Suggestions:
- 
If you have suggestions for this little game or you have advice for me, just send me a message. Since i am still learning new languages and code i am always open for new perspectives and advice :-)
