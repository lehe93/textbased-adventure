# textbased-adventure


Status:
-
Right now the little textbased adventure is in development. The first version "game.py" can be executed in the terminal, as well as the test files in the subfolder (game tests).



To-Dos:
-
- Finalizing the chooseRoom-function in order to get the loop-function going. (currently in progress) 
- Testing and finalizing level ups. (currently in progress) 
- Death leads to a restart (currently in progress)
- Navigation through all rooms with commands (currently stopped in order to finish a first, playable version without to much commands.)
- Safe function with saving the current character and room status in an external file (e.g. txt).
- Load function for loading a saved character/game



Suggestions:
- 
If you have suggestions for this little game or you have advice for me, just send me a message. Since i am still learning new languages and code i am always open for new perspectives and advice :-)

- check_enemy function is done
