# textbased-adventure


Status:
-
The first version of my little game is playable! The game.py file can be executed in the terminal. However there are still some changes and some improvements to be made. Mainly adding some more items and ending the game, when the endboss is dead. After that i want to write less repetitive code. 



To-Dos:
-
- Creating more items and place them in different rooms.  
- Navigation through all rooms with commands (stopped in order to finish a first, playable version without to much commands.)
- Further commands for a more individual gaming experience (e.g. like checkPosition, changeRoom, fight, runAway, hide, steal)
- Safe function with saving the current character and room status in an external file (e.g. txt).
- Load function for loading a saved character/game



Suggestions:
- 
If you have suggestions for this little game or you have advice for me, just send me a message. Since i am still learning new languages and code i am always open for new perspectives and advice :-) 



Done:
- 
- Testing and finalizing level ups. (currently in progress) 
- Death leads to a restart (currently in progress)
- check_enemy function is done
- check_items function is done
- enemy objects are done
- fight mode is done
- room objects are done
- Finalizing the chooseRoom-function in order to get the loop-function going.
